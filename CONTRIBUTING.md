# Welcome to The People Board Project Contributing Guide 

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on [The-People-Board](https://github.com/gdsc-jssstu/the-people-board) 🙋‍♂✨

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide, you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New Contributor Guide - Quickstart

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open-source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

### 1. Issues

#### Solve an Issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/github/docs/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. As a general rule, we don’t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### 2. Pull Request

When you are ready to start working on an issue, you can open a pull request (PR) in the repository. PRs are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a PR, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.
Maintianer will review your PR and if it meets the requirements, it will be merged.

### 3. Your PR is Merged!

Congratulations 🎉🎉 The GDSC JSSSTU team thanks you ✨✨

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the [The-People-Board](https://github.com/gdsc-jssstu/the-people-board).

Now that you are part of the GDSC JSSSTU community, see how else you can contribute to the [community repositories](https://github.com/orgs/gdsc-jssstu/repositories)

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](README.md).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.
